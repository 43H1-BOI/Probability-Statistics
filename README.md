### What is a Non-Parametric Test?

A non-parametric test is a type of statistical test that does not assume a specific distribution for the data. These tests are used when you cannot assume that the data follows a normal distribution. They are often used with small sample sizes, ordinal data, or non-continuous data.

### Types of Non-Parametric Tests

Here are some common types of non-parametric tests:

1. **Chi-Square Test**: 
   - Used to compare observed frequencies with expected frequencies.
   - Example: Testing if a die is fair by comparing the frequency of each outcome (1 through 6) with the expected frequency (each should appear about the same number of times).

2. **Mann-Whitney U Test**:
   - Compares differences between two independent groups.
   - Example: Comparing the test scores of two different classes to see if there is a significant difference.

3. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**:
   - Compares differences between two related groups.
   - Example: Comparing the weights of patients before and after a diet program.

4. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**:
   - Compares differences between three or more independent groups.
   - Example: Comparing customer satisfaction scores across different stores.

5. **Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation**:
   - Measures the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables.
   - Example: Determining if there is a relationship between the rank of students' math scores and their science scores.

6. **Friedman Test**:
   - Compares differences between three or more related groups.
   - Example: Comparing the performance of students in different subjects over time.
